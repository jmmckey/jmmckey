- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmmckey
- 👀 I’m interested in rehashing my original CS major skillset C, & C++ but more importantly wanting to get stronger in Python by collaborating with others on intermediate stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS and Lambda realted stuff so Python is my biggest motivation there but I have had several stops and starts with Python b/c it was always an attractive language to me, though the List structure seems odd at times.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python or AWS/Lambda projects.
- 📫 How to reach me you can hit me up on my twitter or via FB or gmail, just drop the repeating 'm' in my handle that I have here.
